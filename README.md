## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello and welcome! ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m a data science intern currently focused on building and experimenting with classification models using scikit-learn. This repository documents my hands-on learning journey as I explore different algorithms, workflows, and evaluation techniques to solve real-world classification problems.

Iâ€™m passionate about turning data into insights, and classification has been a great entry point into the broader world of machine learning. From predicting outcomes based on labeled data to fine-tuning models for better accuracy, Iâ€™ve been diving into both the theoretical concepts and practical implementations of supervised learning.

This repo includes a collection of Jupyter notebooks, scripts, and mini-projects where Iâ€™ve applied algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Support Vector Machines. Each project includes data preprocessing, model training, performance evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrices, as well as visualization to better understand the results.

I'm also learning about cross-validation, feature selection, and hyperparameter tuning to build more robust and generalizable models. Along the way, I document my process and share insights or challenges I encountered, with the aim of making it easier for others who are just getting started with machine learning.

This repository is meant to be both a learning tool and a portfolio of my growing experience in data science. If you're also learning, feel free to explore the code, ask questions, or contribute with suggestions and improvements.

Thanks for checking it out! Iâ€™m excited to continue learning, building, and sharing as I grow in the field of data science. ðŸ“ŠðŸ¤–ðŸ“ˆ
